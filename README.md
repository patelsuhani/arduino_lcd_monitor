## Customization
- You can modify the responses in the `loop()` function by changing the strings within the `switch(reply)` block.
- Adjust the number of responses and their content as desired.

## Note
- Ensure that you have the LiquidCrystal library installed in your Arduino IDE for the code to compile properly.
- This project is for educational and entertainment purposes only. The responses generated on the LCD Screen are random and not based on any real predictive abilities.
